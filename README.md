# C++ Module 04

This module explores subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++. You will build an inheritance tree of animals and magical materia systems to practice virtual functions, deep copies, and multiple inheritance concepts.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./ex01
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./ex02
```

## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Polymorphism:
Create an Animal base class, with derived Dog and Cat classes. Demonstrate virtual functions and subtype polymorphism. Include a WrongAnimal / WrongCat example to show the effect without virtual functions.

ex01 — I don’t want to set the world on fire:
Add a Brain class to Dog and Cat for deep copy tests. Manage dynamic memory carefully to avoid leaks.

ex02 — Abstract class:
Make Animal an abstract base class to prevent direct instantiation. Keep polymorphic behavior intact.
